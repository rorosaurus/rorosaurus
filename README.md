### 👀 I’m interested in full stack, web dev, firmware/hardware, mobile apps, and right-to-repair!
### 👨‍🎓 I’m probably currently learning about next hot microprocessor (and imagining possibilities)!
### 🤝 I’m always looking to collaborate on LED art projects or retro hardware renewal!
### 💭 I document my projects and thoughts on my personal website, [roryhay.es](https://roryhay.es)!
